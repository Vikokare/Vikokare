## 🧠 My Story: Why Computer Science?

My journey into tech didn't start with textbooks—it started with **curiosity**.

As a kid, I was fascinated by how games worked under the hood. That curiosity slowly turned into a desire to understand the **"why" and "how"** behind the systems we use daily. I wasn’t just playing games—I was wondering how physics engines, graphics, and logic all came together. That led me to choose **Computer Science**.

People often ask me,  
> _"Why are you still learning to code when AI is doing everything?"_  

And I tell them:  
> _"Because I don’t just learn to code—I **solve**. And problem-solvers are never out of a job."_

That mindset led me to **Automation**—I started building tools to eliminate repetitive tasks. Whether it was automating browser tasks or system processes, it gave me a mindset of **working smarter**, not harder. Now, I’m diving into **AI and Machine Learning**, taking that same automation mentality and combining it with intelligence—**making systems that learn, adapt, and simplify lives.**

> The CS degree wasn’t just a curriculum.  
> It became a **certification of freedom**—  
> The freedom to build ideas, launch startups, freelance, collaborate, create tools, and contribute to real-world problems.  
> It gave me the keys to an open world, where *my logic becomes reality*.

Every step in my journey—from gaming curiosity to automation to AI—has been fueled by a single goal:  
👉 **Understand how things work and use that knowledge to build something better.**


## ⭐ The Dopamine That Kept Me Going

My first *“I actually built this!”* moment didn’t come from a tutorial—it happened during my **Algorithm and Design class** in my first year.  
Our professor had a rule: _no hand-holding, no hints—just problems and your brain_. While many argued about the difficulty, I saw it as a challenge.  
It was the first time I felt completely responsible for finding a solution.
That challenge, that struggle, that independence—it changed me.  

By **Third Year**, something else clicked.

I used to think **Computer Science** was just about flashy fields like AI, frontend, or backend.  
But the deeper I went, the more I realized—CS is a whole **universe**.

From **Networking** and **Cryptography** to **Operating Systems**, **Compilers**, and even the logic behind how systems talk and trust each other...  
There are so many layers people don’t even know exist, yet they’re what make everything run.  
It’s not just about code. It’s about understanding **how computers think, communicate, and secure themselves** at every level.  
> That realization made me fall in love with the depth of this field—not just the surface.

Realizing that there are more fields to explore what i am seeing is just some water from a well.

## 🎲 The Game

> 🎮 Someday, I want to build my own game inspired by *Pokémon Fire Red*—  
> Simple, pixelated fun... but with deep systems underneath.  
> Complex NPC behaviors, real-time decisions, layered AI—basically, a game that’s more than what it looks like.

## 📈 The Learning Curve

Recently, I found myself **Vibe Coding a bit too much** while coding. I didn’t want to fall behind in this fast-paced world, so I leaned on it to boost speed.  
But I also knew that relying too much would stop me from learning.  
The key? I learned to **strike a balance**:  
> Use tools to accelerate, not to escape thinking.

---

In my work experience, I also learned a **huge lesson** about real-world dev:

I’d spend too much time perfecting tiny things—polishing code, making it too “optimized”—while losing sight of the bigger goal: **shipping the product**.  
My mentors pointed it out. That’s when I realized:  
> In business, **delivering value on time** matters more than writing “perfect” code.

I still care about clean code—but I focus on **impact first**, then optimize later.

Somewhere along the way, I also realized something bigger—I don’t just want to code.  
**I want to create.**

Every mistake, every challenge, every bug... they’re all part of the journey.  
And I’m just getting started. 🚀
